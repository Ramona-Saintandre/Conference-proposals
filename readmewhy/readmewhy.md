# **Why ? ReadMe **

I would like to take the time to thank you for considering me to speak at your conference this year. 

As a new self taught coder, I am learning the importance of version control, primarily Git and Github. 

Even more important, I am learning the importance of a good Readme file. 

## *what is a Readme*

## *why is it important

## *how is it written 

## *Where is it written 

## *What do you do with a readme 

## *Why is a readme so boring*

# Title : Paracord Braclets, its not just a fashion fad 

**Why do I want to present:**
I am currently going through a career change and my goal is to become a developer advocate.
One of the criteria is to do conference talks or presentations.
I attended last year with my grandkids, and they totally loved THAT camp, before we left my granddaughter had made
the decision that she also wanted to present.
She had a blast with the workshops that were presented by the other Geeklings.

**What am I going to present:**
We are going to explain to the kids how our men and women that serve our country use paracord.
We will also explain to them about Operation Gratitude.
Operation Gratitude is an organization that makes care packages for our men and women that are serving and protecting our country.

**What is it's the purpose:**
Here are some of the ways that our Men and Women who serve our country use these paracord bracelets. Secure camouflage nets to trees or vehicles Build a makeshift shelter* Extend a security strap or rope to reach and haul heavy objects Create a harness to extract an injured person from a bad location Make a sling

If you cut the paracord and remove the 7 to 9 nylon strands inside it, they now have Sewing thread to repair gear Emergency sutures to close a wound Fishing line Trip line to secure an area

**Why am I the best person to give this talk:**
Military Service is a very big part of our family. I grew up in the Army. Both of my sons have proudly served this country, two of my granddaughter's father's are currently serving our country. My sister-in-law is 17 months in a 18-month deployment at the writing of this article. My husband and I have been making care packages and bracelets for Operation Gratitude going on 5 years now. We love sharing about this organization, and the importance of what they do.

**Project details:**
We are looking at this being a 90-minute session. In the first 30 minutes, we will go over what paracord is, show some examples of its versatility. We will also give an overview of Operation Gratitude. If accepted we will try and either get a representative from Operation Gratitude, or a service person to help with this part.

In the second half, we will work with the kids/participants, with the pre-made kits that we will build over the summer. The participants will make two bracelets, one for themselves, and one for a service member to be sent via Operation Gratitude, along with a card.

**Project materials:**
***550 paracord*** - We will explain why this is important 
***paracord jig*** - We will provide 
***clasps*** - We will provide 
***Note Cards*** - so that the kids can send a note with their bracelets that they made for them.

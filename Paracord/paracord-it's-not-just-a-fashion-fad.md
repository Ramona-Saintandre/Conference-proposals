# Title : Paracord Braclets, its not just a fashion fad 

# Why do I want to present:  
I am currently going through a career change and my goal is become a developer advocate.   
One of the criteria is do conference talks or presentation.   
I attended last year with my grandkids, and they totally loved THAT camp, before we left my granddaughter had made  
the decision that she also wanted to present.  
She had a blast with the workshops that were presented by the other Geeklings.  

# What am I going to present:  

We are going to explain to the kids how our men and women that serve our country use paracord.   
We will also explain to the about Operation Gratitude.  
Operation Gratitude is an organization that makes care packages for our men and women that are serving and   protecting our country.

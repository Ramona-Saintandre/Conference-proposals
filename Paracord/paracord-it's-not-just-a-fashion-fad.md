# Title : Paracord Braclets, its not just a fashion fad 

# Why do I want to present:  
I am currently going through a career change and my goal is become a developer advocate.   
One of the criteria is do conference talks or presentation.   
I attended last year with my grandkids, and they totally loved THAT camp, before we left my granddaughter had made  
the decision that she also wanted to present.  
She had a blast with the workshops that were presented by the other Geeklings.  

# What am I going to present:  

We are going to explain to the kids how our men and women that serve our country use paracord.   
We will also explain to the about Operation Gratitude.  
Operation Gratitude is an organization that makes care packages for our men and women that are serving and   protecting our country.    

# What is it's purpose:   
***Here are some of the ways that our Men and Women who serve our country use these paracord bracelets.***
*Secure camouflage nets to trees or vechicles*
*Build a makeshift shelter**
*Extend a security strap or rope to reach and haul heavy objects*
*Create a harness to extract an injured person from a bad location*
*Make a sling*

***If you cut the parcord and remove the 7 to 9 nylon strands inside it, they now have*** 
*Sewing thread to repair gear*
*Emergency sutures to close a wound*
*Fishing line*
*Trip line to secure an area*

# Why am I the best person to give this talk:  

Military Service is a very big part of our family. 
I frew up in the Army. 
Both of my sons have proudly served this country, two of my granddaughter's father's are currently serving our country. 
My sister-in-law is 17 months in a 18 month deployment at the writing of this article. 
My husband and I have been making care packages and braclets for Operation Gratitude going on 5 years now. 
We love sharing about this organization, and the importance of what they do.
